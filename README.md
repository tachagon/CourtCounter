# Basketball Scores App
### From Android Basics: User Input Course
I have learned how to make my app interactive using buttons and changing text from [Android Basics: User Input Course](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-user-input--ud836). I have practiced those skills by making a basketball scores app. In this course I learn the basics of Android and Java programming, and take the first step on my journey to becoming an Android developer!
